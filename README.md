COSC is an open source focused tech community based in Chaitanya Bharathi Institute of Technology - Hyderabad who conduct hackathons, bootcamps and workshops to teach students different technologies while promoting open source culture.

We are a group of open source enthusiasts who use and promote open source software. We, students, conduct sessions on different open source software and technologies, and teach our students about them and encourage them to use it.

we feel that Open Source encourages students to collaborate and helps in know how. It provides students insight into better software and also helps to work on them.
